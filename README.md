### Artificial Intelligence x Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms belonging to the group of artificial intelligence algorithms. The objective is to obtain an approximate solution to a problem that has no exact solution.

### As if Charles Darwin's work became art
At the cutting edge of technology and based on Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, genetic algorithms use these notions by applying it to a population of potential solutions to the given problem. Here, the algorithm is used to reproduce an existing image from a population of colored lines. Only those that are close to the original image are kept.
